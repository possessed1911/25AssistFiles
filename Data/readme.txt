ANSWER: 
It is possible your router does not support NAT loopback, To work around this click 'Options' and tick the disable port testing to external IP option. But this means you will not be able to join your own server from the server list. You will need to use the Join button on the server.
   
 
QUESTION: 
When I try and login I get timeout error waiting from response from authorization system?. How can I fix this?
ANSWER:	
Login to BattleTracker.com, try changing your password first, go to 'my profile' - 'password', then try again. If this does not work also try changing your username 'my profile' - 'username' to something without any symbols in it. If this does not work try changing your player name to something without symbols in it, go to 'my profile' then 'tracker settings' then change 'aa2 player name'. Make sure there are no spaces in the name. Also make sure you don't have a firewall or router that is blocking outgoing UDP connections.
   
 
QUESTION: 
When joining a server I get kicked out for unauthorized login. What's causing this?
ANSWER:	
You must not close assist or logout from assist after you have joined a server, closing down assist removes your authorization to play from the system.

QUESTION: 
I am getting kicked from servers for Authorization Slot Closed. What's the reason for this?
ANSWER:	
The reason for this happening will be reported at the bottom of the assist window next to the donate button. This usually means that 2.5Assist is not running or has lost its connection to the master server. You must not close 2.5Assist while in a server because this is holding open your authorization slot.

Submit an honor claim on the aao25.com forums. Someone there should be able to restore your honor.

Your PC is looking for a USB device - e.g. a USB stick or a cell phone - that you've recently plugged in and have removed without using the "remove hardware safely" option in the right hand bottom corner of your screen.

Your version of Assist probably has outdated files. Press the "Reset + Repair AA" button on Assist's INSTALL screen. If there has recently been an update to Assist, this could also mean that the server has outdated files. You should then try again in about an hour.
   
 
QUESTION: 
When will my account be activated?
ANSWER:	An admin will activate your account as soon as possible. They do it for free out of their own time and therefore can't always be ready to activate new accounts at all times. Be patient, an admin will deal with it soon.
   
 
QUESTION: 
Why was my account refused by the administrator?
ANSWER:	
Assist has a "one account per computer rule" so if you already have an account, the new one will not be activated. If you feel the refusal was unjustified, admins could have made a mistake, visit aao25.com and make a post about it in the forums.
   
 
QUESTION: 
Why did I get permanently banned? I didn't do anything wrong!
ANSWER:	
There are sometimes bugs that make the game ban a username for 5 minutes. In these cases it will usually say the ban is permanent even though it's not. Try again in 5 or 10 minutes and it should be fine. If the problem persists, try to find the server owners (usually a clan website) and post there. If, however, there was a message that you were banned when logging in to Assist, then you were banned from Assist. In this case you should go to aao25.com if you wish to make an appeal.
   
 
QUESTION:
